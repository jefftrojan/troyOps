# [DOCS] Add comprehensive guide for secret management

## Which documentation needs improvement?
The secret management section in the README is very brief and doesn't provide enough guidance on how to use SOPS or Sealed Secrets effectively with TroyOps.

## What is the problem with the current documentation?
The current documentation only mentions that TroyOps supports SOPS and Sealed Secrets but doesn't explain:
1. How to set up encryption keys
2. How to encrypt and decrypt secrets
3. How to integrate with different key management systems (AWS KMS, GCP KMS, etc.)
4. Best practices for secret management in a GitOps workflow

## Suggested improvement
Create a comprehensive guide for secret management that includes:
1. Step-by-step instructions for setting up SOPS and Sealed Secrets
2. Examples of encrypting and decrypting secrets
3. Integration guides for different key management systems
4. Best practices for managing secrets in a GitOps workflow
5. Comparison between SOPS and Sealed Secrets to help users choose

This could be a separate documentation page linked from the main README.

## Additional context
Many users are new to GitOps and secret management, so detailed documentation would help them adopt TroyOps more easily. This is especially important for security-sensitive information.
